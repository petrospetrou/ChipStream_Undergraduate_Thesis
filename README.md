## üìú Overview
This repository contains the source files, documentation, and supplementary materials for my undergraduate thesis: **"Bridging Cross-Domain Communication in Asynchronous and Synchronous Digital Systems."** The thesis explores the challenges and methodologies of enabling reliable communication between synchronous and asynchronous digital circuits to improve interoperability and efficiency in semiconductor technology.

A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** was developed as part of this research, and a **video demonstration** of the system is included.

The novelty of this research is the implementation of the **4-phase dual-rail asynchronous communication protocol**, which ensures efficient and reliable data transfer between synchronous and asynchronous circuits.

## üìë Thesis Abstract
This thesis investigates the communication dynamics between synchronous and asynchronous digital circuits to enhance their interoperability and efficiency. Through an extensive study of semiconductor evolution, comparative analysis of synchronous vs. asynchronous systems, and a hands-on implementation, this research aims to minimize latency, maximize throughput, and ensure robust data integrity. The final system demonstrates effective cross-domain communication through strategic hardware and software integration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/petrospetrou/ChipStream_Undergraduate_Thesis.git
 cd ChipStream_Undergraduate_Thesis
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ GUI Application Setup
- The GUI application was developed using **Qt Creator IDE** with **C++**.
- Ensure you have the Qt Creator IDE installed on your system: [Qt Documentation](https://www.qt.io/).
- Open the GUI project in Qt Creator and build it following the IDE's build instructions.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware Setup (MCU/FPGAs)
- The microcontroller used for the bridge hardware is an **ESP32-C6-DevKitM-1**.
- Refer to the hardware documentation: [ESP32-C6-DevKitM-1 User Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32c6/esp32-c6-devkitm-1/user_guide.html).
- Development for the UART communication was done using **PlatformIO** and **CLion IDE**.
- Follow these steps to set up the hardware:
  1. Install [PlatformIO](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/) and CLion IDE.
  2. Open the firmware project in CLion with PlatformIO enabled.
  3. Connect the ESP32-C6-DevKitM-1 to your computer.
  4. Flash the firmware to the microcontroller using:
     ```bash
     platformio run --target upload
     ```

---

## üöÄ Usage
1. **Launch the GUI Application** through the Qt Creator build.
2. **Input Data** to be sent to the asynchronous chip.
3. **Initiate Communication** through the GUI.
4. **Monitor Results** for latency and throughput statistics.
5. **Refer to the Video Demonstration** (`Screen Recording.mov`) for visual guidance.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Known Issues and Troubleshooting
- **Improper Default Initialization of Flash Size:**
  - Issue: During the setup phase of the ESP32-C6-DevKitM-1, flash size was improperly initialized, causing startup errors.
  - Resolution: Flash size configuration was corrected in the initialization script. Ensure your environment settings match the hardware specifications.

- **Data Reception Challenges:**
  - Issue: Data reception between the GUI and bridge hardware occasionally failed due to improper handling of UART buffer overflow.
  - Resolution: Enhanced buffer management logic in firmware resolved the issue.

For more detailed troubleshooting information, please refer to the thesis document.
